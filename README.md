# News App
Welcome to the News app! This is my submission for the News app task, and I have utilized the following packages in the development:

- Carousel_slider: For implementing a carousel of news articles.
- Smooth_page_indicator: For displaying smooth page indicators for the carousel.
- Salomon_bottom_bar: For creating a sleek bottom navigation bar.
- Flutter_hooks: For using hooks to manage state in a concise manner.
- Dio: For making HTTP requests to get the news from https://newsapi.org/.
- Shimmer: For adding shimmering loading effects while loading data.
- fpdart: For handling errors and exceptions in a functional programming style.
- Isar: For caching news stories locally, enabling offline functionality and better performance during connection errors.
- Lottie: For some cool animations.
- Riverpod: For managing state in the app.

## App Functionality
The News app offers the following features:

- Search for news articles on various topics.
- Pagination with a smooth loading effect while scrolling.
- Local caching of news stories and bookmarks for offline access.
- Bookmarked stories are cached to ensure availability, even if not shown on the trending page.

Riverpod is used as the state management solution for the app. It provides a scalable and efficient way to manage app state, ensuring smooth performance and easy maintenance.

### Todo
Make the app responsive in landscape mode to enhance the user experience.
